# Calculator-in-Python

This repository contains a calculator that was developed using Python in 2019 during the "Python from Scratch" course offered by [Pildoras Informaticas](https://www.pildorasinformaticas.es/course/curso-python/). The code in this repository is intended to provide a solid foundation in Python programming and demonstrate how to create a basic calculator using the language.
